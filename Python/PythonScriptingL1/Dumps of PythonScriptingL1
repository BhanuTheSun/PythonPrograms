1. return prime numbers list in the given range of numbers.

   m , n are the numbers given as input (ex: m = 11, n=95)
   put prime numbers between m , n in a list and return that list


   def list_prime(m,n):
       print("Given Range",m "to",n)
       for number in range(m,n+1):
           counter = 0
           for i in range(1,n+1):
              if (number % i) == 0:
                  counter += 1
       	   if counter == 2:
              prime_num_list.append(number)
        return prime_num_list
          
           
   
2. quadratic sequence or 

   input to your function can be any of the two below series of numbers you have to find out what type of series it is and return N-1,N,N+1 th terms by keeping them in a list.
   
   3,6,9,12,....( additive)
   
   2,6,18,54,....(quadratic)
   
   difference between two numbers is 3 this is the common criteria in all the numbers so using this find out N-1,N,N+1 th terms.
   
   
   
   2*3 =6
   6*3=18
   18*3=54... common in these terms is numbers are multiplied by 3 find out N-1,N,N+1 terms.
   
   
   
   
   find out the sequence of above series and print N-1,N,N+1 th numbers put them in list and return.
   
   ex: return ('additive',[N-1,N,N+1]) from a function
